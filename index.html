    After college, I worked at <strong><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">LM Ericsson Nigeria</a></strong> as a Radio Access Network Integration Engineer. I got married in 2015
    to my sweetheart <strong>Azeezat Animashaun</strong> and relocated to the United States in <strong>May 2016</strong>.
    I enrolled at <strong><a href="https://www.centriq.com/">Centriq IT Program</a></strong> in October 2018 for a 4-month IT training that leads to certifications.</p>
